Appboot, which means application BootLoader, is a general application creation platform. 

Appboot creates applications based on [templates](https://github.com/appboot/templates). You can create custom templates to meet different requirements. 

In the template, you can include code, lint configuration, CI&CD, custom scripts, etc.
